## Biblica Bot

![status: active](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-green.svg)

This Telegram bot hopes to make the Bible more accessible, and hopefully to give a timely answer to those looking for it. 

### Installing Libraries
Add new libraries either in app.yaml or add them to requirements.txt (Note that adding them to requirements.txt won't automatically import the libraries! You need to pip install them into a \lib folder still)
